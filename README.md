This repository contains all the knitted files containing the code used for the article:
"The first linkage map for Australo-Papuan Treefrogs (family: Pelodryadidae) reveals the sex determination system of the Green-eyed Treefrog (Litoria serrata)",
published in Heredity.

I will update this readme after publication with relevant links.
